Final Gift Selections: The 3 best specific gift items from the debate are:

1. **Pocket knife**: A pocket knife is an essential tool for any camper. It can be used for a variety of tasks such as preparing food, cutting rope, or even in emergency situations. It's a versatile tool that can be a lifesaver in the wilderness.

2. **Headlamp**: A headlamp is another essential item for camping. It provides hands-free lighting which is important when setting up camp, cooking, or navigating in the dark. It's more practical than a handheld flashlight as it allows the user to fully use both hands.

3. **Waterproof matches**: Waterproof matches are a crucial survival tool. They can be used to start a fire for cooking, warmth, or signaling for help. Unlike regular matches, they won't be rendered useless if they get wet, which can be a common occurrence when camping or in emergency situations.

These three items were chosen because they are all practical, useful, and could potentially be lifesaving in a camping or survival situation. They are all compact and easy to carry, making them convenient for any camping trip.
