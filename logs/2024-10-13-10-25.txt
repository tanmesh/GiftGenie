They provide detailed information on different bird species, their habitats, behaviors, and how to identify them. 

The Celestron Nature DX 8x42 Binoculars are a practical gift that the recipient could use regularly for bird watching, hiking, or even sporting events. The Stokes Select Double Suet Bird Feeder, Audubon Park Songbird Selections, and Nature's Hangout Window Bird Feeder would all be great additions to any backyard, attracting a variety of birds for the recipient to observe. 

Lastly, the National Geographic Kids Bird Guide of North America is a wonderful gift for children, sparking their interest in nature and bird watching from a young age. 

However, while these gifts are indeed useful for someone interested in bird watching, they may not be appreciated by everyone. Not all people have an interest in birds or nature, and these gifts may come across as too niche or specific. The bird watching guides, while informative, may not be of much use to someone living in an urban area with limited access to nature. The binoculars, although versatile, may not be used often if the recipient is not into outdoor activities. 

The bird feeders and bird food, while they could attract birds to a backyard, could also potentially attract pests. The National Geographic Kids Bird Guide, while educational, may not be suitable for older recipients or those without children. 

In terms of practicality, these gifts would be most useful to someone who is already a bird enthusiast or is looking to become one. However, for those who do not share this interest, these gifts may not be as appreciated or used regularly.
